<p>I’m a Developer with 5 years industry experience working in both the private and public sector.</p>

<p>My main specialism is frontend development however I have a lot of experience working in the backend — often the problems I’m solving involve services and tooling that require backend / architecture skills.</p>

<p>I do my best work when working with multidisciplinary teams who care about putting user needs first, where I can get involved in design.</p>

<p>I care a lot about accessibility, privacy and user centered design, so if you do too I'd love to talk to you :)</p>
